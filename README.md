# European-City-Recommender-System
India is a vast country in Southern Asia, and as of June
2023, it is the most populous country. It is a country with
diverse cultures and traditions, vibrant tapestry of customs,
rituals, and festivals celebrated throughout the year. India
has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for
information technology services, with an expanding middle
class. It consists of various kinds of industries flourishing in
different parts of the country.
Despite its significant progress in various sectors, India
still faces several challenges and obstacles on its path to
development. There are several issues to be tackled, including
infrastructure, gaps in educational and skill development,
poverty, corruption. There is a need to come up with initiatives
focusing on inclusive growth, sustainable development, and
social justice for overcoming the hurdles and accelerating
India’s progress towards becoming a developed nation.
We believe that in this huge interconnected world, the
exchange of ideas and best practices between diverse cultures
will play a major factor to enable sustainable development.
Many cities in the European countries are renowned for their
unique blend of history, culture, and innovation, making them
coveted destinations for travelers and admired models for
urban development. If you observe the geographic landscape
of the cities of Udaipur in India and that of Venice in Italy,
they both are pretty much similar, consisting majorly of water
bodies. But, compared to Udaipur, tourism in Venice flourishes
to a large extent.
Hence, our aim is to is to inspire improvements in Indian
cities by learning from the strengths of their European counterparts,
in order to bring out the aspects which have been
overlooked in these cities. This will help to identify adaptable
solutions by considering India’s unique social, cultural, and
economic realities which can aid to enhance the quality of life,
infrastructure, and overall urban experience in the different
Indian cities.
